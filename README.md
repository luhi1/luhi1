* I have been programming and in the cybersecurity space for about 4 years now, and loving every second of it :)

* I have a passion for web development (especially in Golang!) and I **love** making my own specialized versions of existing tools. 

* I am learning about cybersecurity as I am deeply passionate about anonymity and digital privacy. 

* I have been working on a personal financial tracker for the past few weeks, haven't been commiting because of privacy concerns... Be back on here soon!
