* I've been learning to program for the past 5 years, learning bits of everything from full stack web app development to visual sorting algorithms (whatever rabbithole I fall into ðŸ« )
* I am obsessed with all things cybersecurity, in particular networking. I love making little (harmless) malware scripts for my friends and going on rants about anonymization.
