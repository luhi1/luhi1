💻 I am a student/hobbyist programmer turning ideas to life since 2019.

❤️ I have a passion for web development (especially in Golang!) and I **love** making my own specialized versions of existing tools.

🧗‍♂️ Learning about cybersecurity is one of my favorite things to do and I am deeply passionate about anonymity and digital privacy.

📚 I am currently working on a utility for creating fork-bombs (so if you're a pentester give it a shot 😉) based on my promposal 2025.
